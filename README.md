const colorOptions = [
  // ... existing options
  { id: "purple", color: "#9C27B0", label: "Purple" },
];
```

To modify the grid dimensions, update the constants in `App.js`:

- Change `30` to your desired number of rows
- Change `12` to your desired number of weeks
- Each week has 3 sub-columns with an editable week number
